# Filing Issues

You can report bugs and feature requests to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/shukerov/dataforme/issues).
*Please don't ask question in the issue tracker*, instead ask them on the [subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/dataforme).

When you file a bug please include a description, and a copy of the crash from your web console.

# Development

* Make sure you read the [wiki](https://github.com/shukerov/dataforme/wiki).
* Source hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/shukerov/dataforme/issues).
* Development and installation instruction can be found in the README.

*Currently pull requests won't be accepted.* I am working on setting up the following things first:

* Travis CI running tests.
* Working SonarCloud.
* Beefing up the current tests, and writing documentation about how to add more.
* Setting up an eslintrc or something similar.
