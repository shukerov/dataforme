Hopefully by the time you leave this page you will know how to practice your <em>Right of Access</em>. </p> </div> <div class=steps-table> <div class=steps-table-item> <div class=steps-table-header>Request</div> <div class=steps-table-content>a copy of your data by following the instructions on the page</div> </div> <div class=steps-table-item> <div class=steps-table-header>Wait</div> <div class=steps-table-content>until your data copy is gathered, and download your zip file.</div> </div> <div class=steps-table-item> <div class=steps-table-header>Discover</div> <div class=steps-table-content>your data. Disconnect from the Internet and attach it in your browser to generate your personal report.</div> </div> </div> </div> <h1 class=about-content-heading>My right of access?</h1> <div class=about-content> <p class=index-important>You know those messages you send?<br> Your Google searches?<br> Instagram likes, or the music that you stream ...</p> <p>Most of that is stored in a database somewhere, and it is very likely that someone is profiting heavily from it. But this is <em>your</em> data, and <em>you</em> should have control over it.</p> <p>Practicing your right of access is as simple as requesting a copy of that information. Since the <a href=https://eugdpr.org/ target=blank>GDPR</a> went into effect in 2018, you can actually take advantage of that right. Most big web services provide a way for you to get a copy of your digital identity. </p> </div> <h1 class=about-content-heading>Is my data safe here?</h1> <div class=about-content> <p class=index-important>Dataforme never obtains a copy of your data.</p> <p>Your data is therefore as safe as you keep it. Be careful where you store your data backup.</p> <p><em>You</em> are the one who will have to request a copy of your data, <em>you</em> will also have to download it afterwards.</p> <p>This website won't automate anything for you. The reason for that is that it leaves <em>you</em> in control.</p> </div> <h1 class=about-content-heading>I can analyze my data here?</h1> <div class=about-content> <p>That is correct! The analytics part of this website is designed to work <em>offline</em>. I can guarantee that your data copy is never transferred over the internet.</p> <p> The beauty of this website however is that you don't need to trust me - just turn off your internet when you attach your file in your browser. By doing so you can rest assured that it is not being uploaded anywhere.</p> <p>Click on one of the tiles above to get started. You can learn more about your right of access for each web service there.</p> </div> <h1 class=about-content-heading>Full Transparency</h1> <div class=about-content> <p class=index-important>This website is Open Source.</p> <p>This means you can view, modify or run a completely local copy of the website if you want.
