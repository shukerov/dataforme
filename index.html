Hopefully by the time you leave this page you will know how to practice your <em>Right of Access</em>. </p> </div> <h1 class=about-content-heading>My right of access?</h1> <div class=about-content> <p class=index-important>You know those messages you send? Your Google searches?<br> Instagram likes, or the music that you stream ...</p> <p>Most of that is stored in a database somewhere, and it is very likely that someone is profiting heavily from it. But this is <em>your</em> data, and it is my belief that <em>you</em> should have control over it.</p> <p>Practicing your right of access is as simple as requesting a copy of that information. Since the <a href=https://eugdpr.org/ >GDPR</a> went into effect in 2018, you can actually take advantage of that right. Most big web services provide a way for you to get a copy of your digital identity. </p> </div> <h1 class=about-content-heading>Is my data safe here?</h1> <div class=about-content> <p class=index-important>Dataforme never obtains a copy of your data.</p> <p>Your data is therefore as safe as you keep it. Be careful where you store your data backup.</p> <p><em>You</em> are the one who will have to request a copy of your data, <em>you</em> will also have to download it afterwards.</p> <p>This website won't automate anything for you. The reason for that is that it leaves <em>you</em> in control.</p> </div> <h1 class=about-content-heading>So I can analyze my data here?</h1> <div class=about-content> <p>That is correct! The analytics part of this website is designed to work <em>offline</em>. I can guarantee that your data copy is never transferred over the internet.</p> <p> The beauty of this website however is that you don't need to trust me - just turn off your internet when you attach your file in your browser. By doing so you can rest assured that it is not being uploaded anywhere.</p> <p>Click on one of the tiles above to get started. You can learn more about your right of access for each web service there.</p> </div> <h1 class=about-content-heading>Full Transparency</h1> <div class=about-content> <p>This website is Open Source. This means you can view, modify or run a completely local copy of the website if you want.

It is my senior project so things will be changing frequently, if this didn't work for you you can let me know <a>here</a>.</p> <p>Your visit to this website was tracked with <a>Google Analytics</a>, which runs on most of the websites you frequently visit. On my to-do list is figuring out a way to make that data public.</p> </div> </div> </div> <footer id=footer><a class=footer-link href=https://shukerov.com>shukerov</a> 2019</footer>  </div> <script src="index.js"></script></body> </html>
