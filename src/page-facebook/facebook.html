              Facebook has some of the best tools on hand to explore your data.
              I strongly recommend you explore them yourself. Read more about it by
              following the link above.

            <strong>NOTE</strong>: Download your data in <strong>JSON</strong> format if you
              plan to analayze it here. The media quality doesn't matter. Only
              message reporting works for now.
