          <h1>About DataForMe:</h1>
          <p>
          <strong>TLDR</strong>: A website that teaches you how to practice
          your Right of Access, and optionally analyzes your data offline.
          </p>
          <p>
          Since the GDPR was passed in 2016, software providers need to
          accommodate the 'Right of Access' for their users.
          What does this mean? It means that <strong>YOU</strong>
          can get a copy of the data that you generate.
          </p>
          <p>
          The goal of this website is to serve as a wiki of how to download
          your data from different web service providers. Click on one of the
          tiles above to learn how to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
          Once you request a copy, you might have to wait up to a
          few days to receive that copy.
          </p>
          <p>
          Afterwards, you can analyze your data here, and hopefully gain some
          insight about how you interact with these web services. By now you
          are probably thinking: 'Why would I ever upload my information to the
          web?'
          </p>
          <p>
          If you didn't ask yourself that question then you are surfing the web
          a tad bit carelessly. Anyway rest assured. This website is client side
          only, this means that it can work offline once you have loaded this
          page. Your data won't ever leave your computer, and will be analyzed
          inside your browser. Still don't trust it? Good. Disconnect from the
          internet when you add your file to be analyzed.
          </p>
          <h2>Why I built this:</h2>
          <p>
          I am a college student studying abroad, who got genuinely excited about his
          right of access to data. I also needed a senior project so I can graduate,
          and this is it! I hope you find this somewhat useful. The code is
          open-source and you can look through it or contribute here.
