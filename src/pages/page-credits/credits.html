DataForMe exists thanks to these open-source libraries:

webpack - an open-source module bundler for JavaScript files
frappe-charts - open-source svg graphing library
zip.js - open-source library for manipulating zip files in the browser
lottie - airbnb animation library used just for nav (probably not needed...)
feather-icons - simply beautiful open-source icons
I am deeply thankful for the help from:

John Clements - my senior project advisor
Erin Sheets - my UI/UX professor
Deric Van Damme, Zoe Cagle, Adam Andersson, Madison Aguirre - my UI/UX class group which helped me identify problems with the UI/UX of the website.
A very big thank you to these people who continously downloaded and tested the website with their own personal data:
