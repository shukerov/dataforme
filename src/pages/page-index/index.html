            Here you can learn how to download and interpret the data that you generate online.
            Hopefully by the time you leave this page
            you will know how to practice your <em>Right of Access</em>.

        <h1 class='about-content-heading'>My right of access?</h1>
        <div class='about-content'>
          <p class='index-important'>You know those messages you send?<br> Your Google searches?<br> Instagram likes, or the music that you stream ...</p>
          <p>Most of that is stored in a database somewhere, and it is very likely that someone is profiting heavily from it. But this is <em>your</em> data, and <em>you</em> should have control over it.</p>
          <p>Practicing your right of access is as simple as requesting a copy of that information.
          Since the <a href='https://eugdpr.org/'>GDPR</a> went into effect in 2018, you can actually take advantage of that right. Most big web services provide a way for you to get a copy of your digital identity.

        <h1 class='about-content-heading'>Is my data safe here?</h1>
        <div class='about-content'>
          <p class='index-important'>Dataforme never obtains a copy of your data.</p>
          <p>Your data is therefore as safe as you keep it. Be careful where you store your data backup.</p>
          <p><em>You</em> are the one who will have to request a copy of your data, <em>you</em> will also have to download it afterwards.</p>
          <p>This website won't automate anything for you. The reason for that is that it leaves <em>you</em> in control.</p>
        </div>
        <h1 class='about-content-heading'>I can analyze my data here?</h1>
        <div class='about-content'>
          <p>That is correct! The analytics part of this website is designed to work <em>offline</em>. I can guarantee that your data copy is never transferred over the internet.</p>
          <p>
          The beauty of this website however is that you don't need to trust me - just turn off your internet when you attach your file in your browser. By doing so you can rest assured that it is not being uploaded anywhere.</p>
          <p>Click on one of the tiles above to get started. You can learn more about your right of access for each web service there.</p>

        <div class='about-content'>
          <p class='index-important'>This website is Open Source.</p>
          <p>This means you can view, modify or run a completely local copy of the website if you want. Find the source code <a href='https://github.com/shukerov/dataforme/' target=blank>here</a>.</p>
          <p>This website is still under development. Things will be changing frequently. If the analysis didn't work for you, you can post about it in the <a href="https://reddit.com/r/dataforme" target=blank >subreddit</a>.</p>
