          <div class='about-text about-text-full'>
            <p>The website is designed to work <em>offline</em>. All data analysis happens locally, in your browser.</p>
            <p>Your data is therefore as safe as you keep it. Be careful where you store your personal information.</p>
            <p><em>You</em> are the one who will have to request a copy of your data, <em>you</em> will also have to download it afterwards.</p>
            <p>This website won't automate those steps for you. The reason for that is that it leaves <em>you</em> entirely in control.</p>

          <div class='about-text about-text-full'>
            <p>This means you can view, modify or run a completely local copy of the website if you want. Find the source code on <a href='https://github.com/shukerov/dataforme/' target=blank>GitHub</a>.</p>
            <p>This website is still under development. Things will be changing frequently. If the analysis didn't work for you, you can post about it in the <a href='https://reddit.com/r/dataforme' target=blank >subreddit</a> or create an issue on <a href='https://github.com/shukerov/dataforme/issues' target=blank>GitHub</a>.</p>
